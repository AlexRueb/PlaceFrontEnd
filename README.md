This is a basic re-make of the Reddit Place event.

How you can make it work locally for you:
1. Download the repo
2. Have a local server running (like Ampps)
3. Put everything into your Ampps/www/ directory
4. Create a database called 'place' on phpmyadmin
5. From the place db, import pixels.sql
6. Congratulations! You finally got your own place!
